# Browser Support

Some Vaadin addons do not bring any IE support, which isn't too much of a problem since actually only <3% use it. Instead of presenting the users an unusable UI, tell them that this application does not support it anymore. 
Also motivate them to download another browser and visit this website again!

## Development instructions

Starting the test/demo server:
```
mvn jetty:run
```

This deploys demo at http://localhost:8080
